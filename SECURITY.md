The Recipe Admin UI Service team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly
disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@yourcompany.com](mailto:security@yourcompany.com)
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the [GitHub Security tab](../../security/advisories/new) to report privately

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days with a more detailed response
- **Resolution**: Security fixes will be prioritized and released as soon as possible

### Security Update Process

1. **Confirmation**: We'll confirm the vulnerability and determine its severity
2. **Fix Development**: Our team will develop and test a fix
3. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We'll work with you to determine an appropriate disclosure timeline
4. **Release**: Security patches will be released across supported versions
5. **Announcement**: We'll publish a security advisory detailing the issue and fix

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- Always use the latest version of the application
- Use HTTPS in production environments
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
